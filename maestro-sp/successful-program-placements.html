								<h2>Contractors (GL)</h2>
								<h3>Problem</h3>
								<p>MGA approached Maestro in need of assistance placing a residential and commercial contractor including construction defect states.</p>
								<h3>Solution</h3>
								
							


<p>Maestro partnered the MGA with an excellent AM Bestâ€™s rated insurance carrier partner looking to expand in the construction space.</p>


<p>Under Paul's direction the department began to focus more of their attention on MGA program business and working closer with Marsh to service their reinsurance needs for single parent and group captives.  The Alternative Risk Division was formed in 2002. In 2004, Paul was approached by Benfield to expand their facultative operations on a national basis.  He demonstrated the ability to build a new operation and give it instant credibility in a very short time frame. </p>



<p>Paul joined MSC as a Partner in 2007. His main responsibilities include the procurement of MGA program business and securing a suitable carrier to partner with the MGA. Services also include reinsurance placements and assisting the MGA in finding quality Third Party Administrators and other service providers.</p>


<p>Paul's favorite pastime is baseball and he has served the local community by coaching his son's and daughter's teams for the past several years.</p>
